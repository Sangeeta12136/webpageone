        <p> ABOUT </p>
    <p> My name is Sangeeta Johri and currently I am pursuing my second Master of Science degree in Instructional Technology online from the University of South Florida. I am also currently working as an online ESL Lecturer at the Arkansas State University, and as an EAP instructor at Hillsborough Community College. Professionally, I am very dedicated and motivated to both of my professions. Being an ESL lecturer/instructor, I previously worked at many reputed universities. I also presented to several international and national conferences and I am a published author also. I am equally motivated towards the instructional designing as this is the only field which takes you a step ahead after teaching into the designing or development of the curriculum and the courses, which is also one of my passions. This website also is my journey or my pursuit towards learning new tools or technologies into the instructional designing.
